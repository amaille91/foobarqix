# Compilation

`mvn package`

# Test

`mvn verify`

Note: the main method is actually unuseful since there is no user interaction. No manual testing has been done for now

Possibles improvements:
- handling the 'track zeroes' functionality, probably as a mix between the scanner which would track them as 3-5-7 but returning the empty string if the result is all '*'
and dealing with zeroes in the Main#compute method depending on the final for (foobarqix vs numbered form)
- adding some interactivity (e.g. via a simple cli)
